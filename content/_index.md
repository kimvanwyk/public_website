Welcome to Kim van Wyk's currently-sparse website. I'm a happily married electronic engineer turned software developer/DevOps engineer living in [eThekwini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EThekwini_Metropolitan_Municipality) in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), currently working for [SA Home Loans](https://www.sahomeloans.com).

This site is a replacement for an ancient and creaking Wordpress site which finally fell over. I intend to bring its contents to this site over time, but as with almost every personal software project, this will take way longer than I think it will.

You can have a look at various pieces of code and software projects I've written or contributed to at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/kimvanwyk). I use GitHub as a mirror from [my GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/kimvanwyk) - all my own projects are at GitLab.

I've presented a few talks at conferences, including [PyConZA](https://za.pycon.org/):

* At the 2019 in-person PyConZA: [Automating infrastructure at SA Home Loans with Python (and friends)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT8Pxayqh84)
* At the 2020 virtual PyConZA: [Laying some of the foundations so your fellow developers can start on the ground floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8WmOM5Pukc)

I spend some of my spare time serving people in need as an active member and current president of the [North Durban Lions Club](https://northdurbanlions.org.za/). I have also been privileged to be involved for many years at the Lions District level for [District 410E](https://lions410e.org.za/), including serving as [District Governor](https://members.lionsclubs.org/EN/districts/index.php) for the 2016 / 2017 year.
