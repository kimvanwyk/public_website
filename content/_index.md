Welcome to Kim van Wyk's currently-sparse website. I'm a happily married electronic engineer turned software developer/DevOps engineer living in [eThekwini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EThekwini_Metropolitan_Municipality) in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), currently working for [SA Home Loans](https://www.sahomeloans.com).

This site is a replacement for an ancient and creaking Wordpress site which finally fell over. I intend to bring its contents to this site over time, but as with almost every personal software project, this will take way longer than I think it will.

You can have a look at various pieces of code and software projects I've written or contributed to at [my GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/kimvanwyk). [My GitHub account](https://github.com/kimvanwyk) is almost entirely mirrored from my GitLab account - all my own projects are at GitLab. I also have a few Docker images at [my DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/u/kimvanwyk/).

I have an infrequently posted-to [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kim_vanwyk).

I've presented a few talks at conferences, including [PyConZA](https://za.pycon.org/):

* At the 2019 in-person PyConZA: [Automating infrastructure at SA Home Loans with Python (and friends)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT8Pxayqh84)
* At the 2020 virtual PyConZA: [Laying some of the foundations so your fellow developers can start on the ground floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8WmOM5Pukc)

It was a great pleasure to be a guest host on [Episode 310](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/310/ama-ask-me-anything-with-michael) of Michael Kennedy's consistently excellent Talk Python To Me podcast. I also had the privilege of being on a panel discussion on little automation tools in Python on [Episode 327](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/327/little-automation-tools-in-python) of the podcast, with [Rivers Cuomo](https://twitter.com/RiversCuomo), [Jay Miller](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller), [Rusti Gregory](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/194/learning-and-teaching-python-in-a-vacuum) and [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy).

I spend some of my spare time serving people in need as an active member and 4-time paast  president of the [North Durban Lions Club](https://northdurbanlions.org.za/). I have also been privileged to be involved for many years at the Lions District level for [District 410E](https://lions410e.org.za/), including serving as [District Governor](https://members.lionsclubs.org/EN/districts/index.php) for the 2016 / 2017 year.
