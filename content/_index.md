Welcome to Kim van Wyk's currently-sparse website. I'm a happily married electronic engineer turned software developer/DevOps engineer/data engineer living in [eThekwini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EThekwini_Metropolitan_Municipality) in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa), currently working for [SA Home Loans](https://www.sahomeloans.com).

This site is a replacement for an ancient and creaking Wordpress site which finally fell over. I intend to bring its contents to this site over time, but as with almost every personal software project, this will take way longer than I think it will.

You can have a look at various pieces of code and software projects I've written or contributed to at [my GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/kimvanwyk). [My GitHub account](https://github.com/kimvanwyk) is almost entirely mirrored from my GitLab account - all my own projects are at GitLab. I also have a few Docker images at [my DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/u/kimvanwyk/).

I have a fairly infrequently posted-to [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/kim_vanwyk) and a more recent <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@kimvanwyk">Mastodon account</a>.

I've presented a few talks at conferences, including [PyConZA](https://za.pycon.org/):

* At the 2019 in-person PyConZA: [Automating infrastructure at SA Home Loans with Python (and friends)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT8Pxayqh84)
* At the 2020 virtual PyConZA: [Laying some of the foundations so your fellow developers can start on the ground floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8WmOM5Pukc)
* At the 2022 hybrid PyConZA, with the in-person portion in my hometown of eThekwini: [Turning out short-notice voting tools in Django for a suddenly-online convention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWcDr0L4-ZE)
* At the 2023 hybrid PyConZA, with the in-person portion again in my hometown of eThekwini: [Dynamically serving REST endpoints for database stored procedures with FastAPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-HTUVpbuPI) - despite the mouthful of a title this talk is mainly about generating code, as in using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) to make text files of valid code that get executed in a second step

I've helped organise the 2020-2024 PyConZA conferences and had the privilege of co-chairing the 2021 online conference and chairing the 2022 and 2023 hybrid conferences.

I've had the great pleasure of contributing to several of my favourite technical podcasts:

* As a guest host on [Episode 310](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/310/ama-ask-me-anything-with-michael) of Michael Kennedy's consistently excellent Talk Python To Me podcast. 
* On a panel discussion on little automation tools in Python on [Episode 327](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/327/little-automation-tools-in-python) of the Talk Python To Me podcast, with [Rivers Cuomo](https://twitter.com/RiversCuomo), [Jay Miller](https://twitter.com/kjaymiller), [Rusti Gregory](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/194/learning-and-teaching-python-in-a-vacuum) and [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy).
* As a guest on [Episode 264](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/264/we-re-just-playing-games-with-jupyter-at-this-point) of [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) and [Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken)'s informative and insightful PythonBytes podcast
* On a panel discussion on evaluating new open source tech on [Episode 397](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/397/evaluating-new-open-source-tech-panel) of the Talk Python To Me podcast, with [Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel](https://twitter.com/emilyemorehouse), [Cecil Phillip](https://hachyderm.io/@cecilphillip), [≈Åukasz Langa](https://mastodon.social/@ambv), [Gareth Thomas](https://pythonist.as/@thestub), [Dan Gerlanc](https://fosstodon.org/@dgerlanc)  and [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy).

I spend some of my spare time serving people in need as an active member and 4-time past president of the [North Durban Lions Club](https://northdurbanlions.org.za/). I have also been privileged to be involved for many years at the Lions District level for [District 410E](https://lions410e.org.za/), including serving as [District Governor](https://members.lionsclubs.org/EN/districts/index.php) for the 2016 / 2017 year.
