title: "A Full Pun(net) of Avocados"
---

Some time ago on a group chat, [Johan Kohler](https://masto.ai/@voyager42) and I had a very punny and (to me at least) very funny exchange (humour mainly thanks to Johan). I had asked a question about a connection issue I was getting with [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/), which started us off with this brilliant first entry from Johan:

<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>Have you tried adding Leminjooce? I forgot who makes it, but I've heard it can improve the experience.</code><br/>
<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>no, but I did try the Garlik and BlkPppr modules.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>Hmm... Sounds like a tricky issue then. You could try something completely different, like HMUS. It has mostly the same features but is built on a different framework. It also works with Garlik and BlkPppr. I think some people in this channel are very familiar with HMUS.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>If you installed guacamole using tapas you may even have HMUS already. Worth checking.</code><br/>
<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>Unfortunately not, I extracted it manually from the Avocado container ecosystem and then compressed it.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>That approach makes sense if you want to add more instances organically.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>Are you using the official commercial version of Avocado or did you get it from a third-party vendor?  The third-party one is often a lot cheaper but it is harder to obtain, depending on your region.</code><br/>
<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>We have a large number of local third-party vendors at several locations convenient to my office, all with direct road access.</code><br/>
<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>I also have a completely local supplier on my premises, but supply is extremely erratic.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>If it is so common in your area maybe it is a bandwidth issue. I assume you are using fibre?</code><br/>
<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>Fibre at the core of the system, but fleshed out with other supplementary items.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>Probably not that then. I suggest you check the  makefile of guacamole for options to tweak or try a different execution worker. Maybe you can spot a pattern which can help to narrow it down.</code><br/>

Breaking the fourth wall somewhat, I had to ask about the last one:

<code style="color: blue;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Kim: </strong>I'll confess I was getting more and more obscure but you've outpunned me, I don't get your last 2.</code><br/>
<code style="color: red;word-break:normal;overflow-wrap:break-word;"><strong>Johan: </strong>Use a different recipe or let someone else make it.</code><br/>

For the non-Durbanites, my reference to local third-party vendors is referencing people selling avos at traffic intersections, a common sight in Durban. The completely local supply is a reference to the avo tree I had in my garden at the time.
