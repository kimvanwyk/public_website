[Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)'s context menu used to offer useful things like italics and the like. Now those tools are harder to find in favour of the magic make-it-up bullshit machine which is as likely to improve my writing as me asking my 6 year old nephew for a hand. 

Confluence is a professional tool in which I conduct my **professional** job as a **_professional_** - assuming the most useful thing to me is assistance from the glorified Markov chain to do my job rather than offering essential tools is frankly insulting.

An option to get this rubbish out of my context menu would be nice but I can't find one (although finding config options in Confluence is itself an adventure, maybe I've just missed it). I cynically suspect though that an option like that would be admitting that some people don't want the all-singing all-dancing AI every company on the planet is inexplicably pivoting to.

A screenshot of the offending context menu - "Improve Writing" loads the AI tool:
