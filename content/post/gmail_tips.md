2 [gmail](mail.google.com) tips I've found useful over many years. Assuming an address of *address@gmail.com*:

### +suffix

All of
* *address+foo@gmail.com*
* *address+bar@gmail.com*
* *address+evilcorp@gmail.com*

come to *address@gmail.com*. 

I find this useful for determining where spam came from, by determining which provider or service I used a particular **+suffix** address with.

### Extra periods

All of
* *add.ress@gmail.com*
* *a.ddress@gmail.com*
* *addre.ss@gmail.com* 

come to *address@gmail.com*. 

I find this useful for opening additional accounts for my wife or other family members on services that stupidly insist on unique email addresses for no legitimate reason.
