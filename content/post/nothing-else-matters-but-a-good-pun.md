Several of us thrashed out a very punny heavy metal conversation about Metallica today â€“ here it is in marked-up glory.

<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> &lt;3 the S&M version of Nothing Else Matters</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple">* Jeremy nods.</code><br/>
<code>Tristan nods as well</code><br/>
<code>Colin: man everyone is listening to Metalica lately</code><br/>
<code>Colin: including me</code><br/>
<code style="color:red">* netgate always listens to metallica</code><br/>
<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> just, selectively</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> I was too, a few minutes ago</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple">* Jeremy listens to more Bach.</code><br/>
<code style="color:green">* Johan also listens to Bach</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> Metallica wins this round...</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> you don't want to be picking fights with Metallica</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> they have a huge gorilla who plays the bass</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> No, doing so would be unforgiven.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> aside from it being unforgiven, they may well up the anti and decide it's Killing Time</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> If you beat them, though, you'd be the Hero of the Day.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> given their bassist gorilla, beating them is probably a Thing that Should Not Be</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> although, once you'd done so you could Turn the Page and move on</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Of course, you'd have to be somewhat insane to consider it. I'd recommend a lobotomy to save them the trouble -- I've been taking a Crash Course in Brain Surgery.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> that probably alters your eating patterns. Do your subjects become Breadfans?</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Kim: No, I'm a better Master of Puppets than that.</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> The only real side effect is a moderate case of Motorbreath.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> clearly this is not the busiest week - Tuesdays Gone already and we're debating One of the most impossible items we've ever discussed. We must be Stone Cold Crazy</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> I've been waiting on database stuff a lot. I can't really do much Until it Sleeps.</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Why is the rest of the gang not joining in this Devil's Dance?</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> do you think they will? I hope you're not waiting for the Day that Never Comes</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> I Disappear</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> You're just worried they might be Better Than You...</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> perhaps they're otherwise occupied. Too much Whiskey in the Jar</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Am I Evil? I always just ascribe the worst motives to their non-participation.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> I prefer to be more generous, more of a Loverman if you will. I think maybe they're just waiting for the thread to Die, Die (my Darling)</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> I keep wanting to work "Sympathy for the Devil" in. Maybe it's the reference to Blitzkrieg that does it.</code><br/>
<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> my luck's about as good as you could get with a No Leaf Clover, so I may have to be counted out</code><br/>
<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> even if that leaves me Unforgiven</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> You can't bring in "Sympathy for the Devil"! That's a different band - it could lead to Civil War. Someone will end up Knocking On Heavens Door</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Too Late, Too Late. Unforgiven's already been used.</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> If you're going to start rhyming again, I'll make you Jump in the Fire...</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> The Memory Remains of that, Jeremy?</code><br/>
<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> let's just launch him to Orion</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> hopefully you'll just pass out though, and it will be the clue to "Enter Sandman"</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> Bitter like Cyanide I bet.</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> I've always been partial to Astronomy.</code><br/>
<code style="color:green"><b>Johan:</b> Sad but True</code><br/>
<code style="color:red"><b>Netgate:</b> oh, The Struggle Within.....how one must choose...</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Although I'm seldom awake enough at the Small Hours.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> this is taxing my ability to work from memory alone. I had to look a few titles up. The More I See now the easier it should get</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> That's hardly the right Attitude to bring to this, Kim.</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> The Wait before I started looking names up was quite difficult though. It was like a little Creeping Death - it gave me a headache</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> I've been Fuelled with new ideas</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Memory a bit of a Fixxer upper? You must be getting old...</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> Mama Said I'm not old yet, so no, I'm not</code><br/>
<code style="color:purple"><b>Jeremy:</b> Don't think you can Slither out of it that easily...</code><br/>
<code style="color:blue"><b>Kim:</b> Age is merely in the Eye of the Beholder, after all. Wherever I May Roam, I remain youngish</code></p>
