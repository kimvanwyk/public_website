It's been about 14 years since I [wrote in praise of Emacs](https://kimvanwyk.co.za/tags/emacs/) - I still use it daily and it looks likely to be my editor for a long time to come. This post is to make a more easily found home for a [Mastodon post and reply thread](https://fosstodon.org/@kimvanwyk/110600813366396782) I recently wrote about Emacs:

**The original post:**

*On an excellent [Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/) [episode](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/418/how-to-keep-a-secret-in-python-apps) on key management, [glyph](https://blog.glyph.im/) gave a brilliant reflection on why he still uses emacs and I realised the same reason is mainly why I still use it after 20+ years: Nothing else facilitates, emphasises and just plain groks text editing the way emacs does (except probably vim). Other tools are better IDEs, have better integrations, offer better auto-completion and etc but emacs is so good at writing and editing text I find other tools too frustrating to use.*

**In reply to very helpful suggestions of emacs bindings in VS Code:**

*I've tried hard to use vscode with the key binding extensions, I can see what I'm missing. Unfortunately:*
* *I had to use the mouse too much (ie at all);*
* *decades of muscle memory demanded keys and chords that just weren't there*
* *I've grown to depend on paradigms invented before I was born such as text region manipulation in ways vscode doesn't consider.*

**Finishing the posts with a smidgeon of self-awareness:**

*I fully realise this is a list of the personal idiosyncrasies of a curmudgeonly greybeard developer.*
