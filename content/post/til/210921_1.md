title: "Today I Learned: 21/09/2021 - Windows internet settings for an internal network with fully qualified domain names"
---

On several versions of Windows, many internet configuration items are set using Internet Explorer, including several security settings. In Internet Explorer, selecting *Settings* -> *Internet Options* -> *Security* will yield this dialog and several submenus:

I recently learned that one of the ways Windows differentiates between the **Internet** and **Local intranet** zones is by domain name - if you access services by their host name alone (e.g. *computer01*) it considers it to be on the **Local intranet**. If you access services by a fully qualified domain name (e.g. *computer01.mynetwork.com*), even if that FQDN is entirely internal to your network and the traffic never leaves your network, it considers it to be on the **Internet**. Accordingly, you'll need to apply changes to the **Internet** zone settings for them to be effective and not just concentrate on the **Local intranet** section.

Alternatively, you can add a wildcard entry to the **Local intranet** zone for your domain name, by clicking *Sites* -> *Advanced* and adding **.mynetwork.com* to the zone. Settings for the **Local intranet** zone will then be applied to sites that match the wildcard.
