title: "Today I Learned: 17/09/2021 - Large scale text replacement in a running Docker container"
---

For reasons no else need be slightly horrified by, I found myself recently needing to recursively replace some text in source files in a running Docker container using an orchestration tool. This could be done manually by **exec**ing into the container and then running the necessary commands, but this approach is awkward via an automated tool like [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/). 

I settled on a hideous but workable one line monstrosity:
```bash
docker exec CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash -c 'grep -l -Z -r -o "TEXT-TO-REPLACE" /base-dir/ | xargs -0 sed -i "s|TEXT-TO-REPLACE|NEW-TEXT|g"';
```

Passing the command to */bin/bash* with **-c** keeps the pipe as part of the command run inside the container. If the *grep ... | xargs ...* command was passed directly to **docker exec** the shell would treat the pipe as the end of the command and pipe the result of *docker exec ... grep ...* into **xargs** on the calling shell, not in the container.
