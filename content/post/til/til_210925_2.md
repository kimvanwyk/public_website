title: "Today I Learned: 25/09/2021 - Extracting the first page of a PDF as an image"
---

To facilitate the preview images of Lions District newsletters on [this page](https://lions410e.org.za/news.html), here is an [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) command I run on my Linux PC. This yields an image of +/- 100kB at a perfectly adequate quality for a preview:

```bash
convert -quality 100 -density 100 -background white -flatten PDF_FILE.pdf[0] IMAGE_FILE.jpg
```
