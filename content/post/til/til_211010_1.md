title: "Today I Learned: 10/10/2021 - Getting a list of video names from a YouTube playlist"
---

To faciliate review of the videos from the [2021 PyConZA](https://za.pycon.org/) I needed to get a list of the video titles in the playlist but not actually download the videos. I found [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) is able to do this with the *--flat-playlist* option. Combined with the *-j* option for JSON output and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a list of titles can be extracted like so:

```bash
youtube-dl --flat-playlist -j PLAYLIST_URL | jq .title
```
