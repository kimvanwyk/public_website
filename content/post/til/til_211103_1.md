title: "Today I Learned: 03/11/2021 - Modifying all the files in subdirectories with a common element in their name"
---

I recently added a new domain to an nginx config file templating system. The easiest way to do this was to copy all the subdirectories named for a previous domain with the same settings to new subdirectories named for the new domain. I then however needed to replace all references to the original domain in the files in those subdirectories. I had to remind myself how to do this with find and sed:

```bash
find . -path "*NEW*" -type f | xargs sed -i "s|OLD|NEW|g"
```

The *[find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)* command's **-path** argument will return all file and directory paths with the *NEW* string in them. The **-type** option restricts the returned set to just regular files. Piping those into *[xargs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html)* and *[sed](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1p.html)* will replace the *OLD* string with the *NEW* one on each of the *find* command's file paths and save them in place with the **-i** flag.
