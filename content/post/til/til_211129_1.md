title: "Today I Learned: 29/11/2021 - A possible solution to problems connecting to an older MSSQL server via ODBC on Ubuntu 21.04"
---

Having moved laptops and changed OS from Ubuntu 20.04 to [PopOS 21.04](https://blog.system76.com/post/655369428109869056/popos-2104-a-release-of-cosmic-proportions) I could not connect to an older version Microsoft SQL Server using ODBC. The most prevalent suggestion Google provided was to use a lower TLS level, but I knew from previous experience with the server that it supported TLS v1.2. A related suggestion was to permit weaker ciphers, which turned out to be the trick.

Following the advice [here](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/issues/610#issuecomment-759713763) I altered my OpenSSL conf file at */etc/ssl/openssl.cnf* file by:
* Adding **openssl_conf = default_conf** to the top of the file
* Adding new sections to the bottom of the file:
```ini
[ default_conf ]
ssl_conf = ssl_sect

[ssl_sect]
system_default = system_default_sect

[system_default_sect]
MinProtocol = TLSv1.2
CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=1
```

The default *CipherString* is **SECLEVEL=2** so this change will permit weaker ciphers in use on older servers.
