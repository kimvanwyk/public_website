title: "Today I Learned: 14/01/2022 - SMTP settings for a custom domain Office 365 Exchange installation"
---

While developing an automated email system for the upcoming [Lions MD410 Convention](https://lionsconvention.co.za/) I needed the SMTP settings for the Lions District 410E Office 365 Exchange server at the **lions410e.org.za** domain. Some googling and trial and error led me to [this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-8361e398-8af4-4e97-b147-6c6c4ac95353) and these settings:

* **SMTP Server**: smtp.office365.com
* **Port**: 587
* **Security Mode**: STARTTLS

For the username and password, use the email address that will be sending the emails.

As an example, for the [Python mailtools](https://pypi.org/project/mailtools/) package:

```python
from mailtools import SMTPMailer
mailer = SMTPMailer(
    "smtp.office365.com",
    port=587,
    username="email_address@lions410e.org.za",
    password="PASSWORD",
    transport_args={"security": "STARTTLS"},
)

mailer.send_plain(
    "email_address@lions410e.org.za", 
    ["recipient1@recipient.com", "recipient2@recipient.com"], 
    "Hello!", 
    "Insightful email message goes here!"
)

```
