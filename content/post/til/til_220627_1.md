title: "Today I Learned: 27/06/2022 - microphone echo-cancellation on Ubuntu/Pop OS 21.10"
---

I realised recently that my USB microphone was producing a white noise hiss when I wasn't speaking and somewhat distorting my voice. Aside from an apology to anyone subjected to this while I was blissfully unaware, I've addressed it using some of the tips [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1235198/white-noise-in-microphone-with-ubuntu-20-04):

* Add or uncomment this line in */etc/pulse/default.pa*:
```
load-module module-echo-cancel
```

* Execute these commands to load the module:
```
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start 
```
