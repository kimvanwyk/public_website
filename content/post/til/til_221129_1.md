---

Every few years, I need to remind myself how to prevent a bash default behaviour I find very irritating - when autocompleting a directory that is a symlink (ie by pushing TAB) the directory doesn't get a trailing slash. I then need to add the trailing slash myself before continuing to autocomplete directory names. 

To fix this, this value can be set in your systems *~/.inputrc* file:
```bash
set mark-symlinked-directories on
```

If you don't have a *~/.inputrc* file (I don't) this can be set directly in your *~/.bashrc* file:

```bash
bind 'set mark-symlinked-directories on'
```

I probably find a different reference every time I look this up - the most recent one I used was [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/257861/automatically-add-slash-when-navigating-through-symlink).
