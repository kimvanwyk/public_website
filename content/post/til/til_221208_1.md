title: "Today I Learned: 08/12/2022 - /dev/tty errors using scp in Docker"
---

I hit an unexpected error today while using scp in a script executing in a Docker container - an inability to use a tty. This was correct in that I wasn't running Docker with the interactive or terminal flags (commonly used as *-it*). The relevant *-vv* output from scp was:

*debug1: read_passphrase: can't open /dev/tty: No such device or address* \
*Host key verification failed.* \
*lost connection*

What confused me is that I was explicitly providing a key file without a passphrase. 

Some headscratching later, I found the error was a little misleading - scp **did** need a tty, but not to ask for a passphrase. It wanted permission to override the existing host key details of my remote server in the *~/.ssh/known-hosts* file. Since my Docker container was intended to be removed after each run, this was most easily fixed by telling scp not to check the key, by adding 

```bash
-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

to the arguments.
