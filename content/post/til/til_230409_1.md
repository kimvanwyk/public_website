title: "Today I Learned: 09/04/2023 - Preventing upload to PyPI with the \"Private\" trove classifier"
---

For several years, I've accidentally uploaded Python packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) on rare but annoying occasions instead of my employer's internal PyPI. I've long wished for a means to prevent this, even suggesting that PyPI would benefit from a feature to refuse to upload packages with a specified prefix in their name on a per-user level.

I was listening to [this helpful episode](https://testandcode.com/197) of Brian Okken's excellent [Test and Code](https://testandcode.com/) podcast where he and the ever-informative [Brett Cannon](https://snarky.ca/) mentioned something I had never heard of - the **"Private"** classifier for the [trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) of a Python package's metadata. To quote the [Python packaging docs](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#configuring-metadata): 

> To prevent a package from being uploaded to PyPI, use the special "Private :: Do Not Upload" classifier. PyPI will always reject packages with classifiers beginning with "Private ::".

I've tested this classifier in the *pyproject.toml* file of a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) driven work project, by adding this to the **[tool.poetry]** section:

>classifiers = [
>    "Private :: Do Not Upload",
>]

PyPI refused my upload, which is exactly what I wanted, while my internal [pypiserver](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver) Python packaging index took the upload as normal.

Thank you to Br(ian|ett) for this very helpful tip.
