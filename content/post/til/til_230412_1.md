title: "Today I Learned: 12/04/2023 - Using a newer poetry (in 2023) with pypiserver"
---

I recently moved our corporate Python package index from [devpi](https://github.com/devpi/devpi) to [pypiserver](https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/) - devpi was great but was more complex and configurable than our simple needs require.

I almost immediately ran into a problem with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) though - third-party installs on existing codebases were failing with an error indicating the package was not listed in the **poetry.lock** file. I "fixed" this issue with a hack by configuring poetry to not use its "experimental" new installer, which despite the name is neither new nor experimental any more. This triggered warnings from poetry but did work.

I realised today though that I was putting a bandaid on the wrong problem - the actual issue is that pypiserver is configured by default to use an MD5 hash, while poetry is expecting a more modern SHA256. The more correct fix is to have pypiserver use SHA256, by passing "*--hash-algo=sha256*" to pypiserver. This can safely be applied to an existing pypiserver by restarting it with this command and the pypiserver should retain existing packages (as per [this Github discussion](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/issues/452)). I have made this change to my pypiserver and reverted my poetry to use the experimental new installer again and everything works as expected.
