title: "Today I Learned: 19/11/2023 - Piping to the clipboard on a linux system"
---

I occasionally output text from command line tools on my Ubuntu linux machine entirely to put them into the system clipboard to paste into some other tooling. I recently found this can be done via a pipe to the **xclip** command, which was already installed on my system. As an example:

```bash
echo "war_and_peace_in_the_original_klingon.txt | translator | xclip -selection clipboard
```

The *-selection clipboard* portion uses the system clipboard, instead of an X buffer which **xclip** defaults to.
