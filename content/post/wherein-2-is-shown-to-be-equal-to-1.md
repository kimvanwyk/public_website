Hereâ€™s a little maths trick I have for some reason carried around in my brain for years:

$$\text{Let } a = b$$
$$\Rightarrow a^2 = ab$$
$$\Rightarrow a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2$$
$$\Rightarrow (a + b)(a - b) = b(a-b)$$
$$\text{Dividing through by the common} (a - b)$$
$$\Rightarrow (a + b) = b$$
$$\text{But } a = b$$
$$\Rightarrow (b + b) = b$$
$$\Rightarrow 2b = b$$
$$\Rightarrow 2 = 1$$

Why this is possible is left as an excercise for the reader :-)
